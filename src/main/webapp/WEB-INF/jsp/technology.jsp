		<div class="panel">Gartner, Inc. today highlighted the top
			technology trends that will be strategic for most organizations in
			2017. Analysts presented their findings during the sold-out Gartner
			Symposium/ITxpo, which is taking place here through Thursday. Gartner
			defines a strategic technology trend as one with substantial
			disruptive potential that is just beginning to break out of an
			emerging state into broader impact and use or which are rapidly
			growing trends with a high degree of volatility reaching tipping
			points over the next five years. Gartner's top 10 strategic
			technology trends for 2017 set the stage for the Intelligent Digital
			Mesh, said David Cearley, vice president and Gartner Fellow. "The
			first three embrace Intelligence Everywhere, how data science
			technologies and approaches are evolving to include advanced machine
			learning and artificial intelligence allowing the creation of
			intelligent physical and software-based systems that are programmed
			to learn and adapt. The next three trends focus on the digital world
			and how the physical and digital worlds are becoming more
			intertwined. The last four trends focus on the mesh of platforms and
			services needed to deliver the intelligent digital mesh."</div>

			<ul>
				<li>IoT and Smart Home Tech. We've been hearing about the
					forthcoming revolution of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and
					resulting interconnectedness of smart home technology for years. So
					what's the holdup? Why aren't we all living in smart, connected
					homes by now? Part of the problem is too much competition, with not
					enough collaboration-there are tons of individual appliances and
					apps on the market</li>
				<li>2. AR and VR. We've already seen some major steps forward
					for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology in
					2016. Oculus Rift was released, to positive reception, and
					thousands of VR apps and games followed. We also saw Pokémon Go, an
					AR game, explode with over 100 million downloads.</li>
				<li>Machine Learning. Machine learning has taken some massive
					strides forward in the past few years, even emerging to assist and
					enhance Google's core search engine algorithm. But again, we've
					only seen it in a limited range of applications. Throughout 2017, I
					expect to see machine learning updates emerge across the board,
					entering almost any type of consumer application you can think of,
					from offering better recommended products based on prior purchase
					history to gradually improving the user experience of an analytics
					app. It won't be long before machine learning becomes a kind of
					"new normal," with people expecting this type of artificial
					intelligence as a component of every form of technology.</li>
				<li>4. Automation. Marketers will be (mostly) pleased to learn
					that automation will become a bigger mainstay in and throughout
					2017, with advanced technology enabling the automation of
					previously human-exclusive tasks. We've had robotic journalists in
					circulation for a couple of years now, and I expect it won't be
					long before they make another leap into more practical types of
					articles. It's likely that we'll start seeing productivity
					skyrocket in a number of white-collar type jobs</li>
