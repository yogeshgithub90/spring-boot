		<button class="accordion">Horoscope Today</button>
		<div class="panel">If you're prepared and well organized,
			Gemini, today should go smoothly and pleasantly. Feel free to indulge
			in fanciful daydreams and things of a whimsical nature. You've earned
			the right to break from the normal routine. If you've been slacking
			off your tasks, however, you will now need to spend some time
			catching up and planning ahead.</div>
		<button class="accordion">Horoscope this week</button>
		<div class="panel">Mercury in Gemini makes an awkward angle to
			Neptune in your professional sector, so a mixed message or slip of
			the tongue could cause problems unless it's nipped in the bud. It
			would be smart to check that others understand what you're saying,
			particularly those in positions of authority. At the same time, you
			might need to be very adaptable if you need to handle someone who
			resists your ideas. But with gentle persuasion, next week could be a
			different story.</div>
		<button class="accordion">Your Health this Month</button>
		<div class="panel">"No matter how good an activity may be for
			you, you probably won't sustain it if you hate doing it," Dr. JoAnn
			Manson says. Dr. Manson is chief of the Division of Preventive
			Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, professor at Harvard
			Medical School, and the lead investigator on several studies on
			women's health. She offers seven easy steps to better health.</div>

		<button class="accordion">Your Wealth this year</button>
		<div class="panel">Mercury enters Gemini on June 6 and the whole
			world may suddenly become much more interesting. Get curious and stay
			that way. Love and romance shine bright for you around the Full Moon
			on June 9. A lover may suddenly get generous and affectionate beyond
			belief. Embrace the attention and make sure that any acts of
			generosity and kindness have no strings attached. The June 23 New
			Moon empowers your money and financial prospects. An earning
			opportunity could be lucrative and keep you too busy to spend more
			than you need or intend. Involvement in a startup or kick-starter
			could happen now.</div>
